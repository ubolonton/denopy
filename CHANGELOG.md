## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2024-02-19
### Changed
- JavaScript values of complex types are no longer converted to Python `dict`/`list` by default, but wrapped in `JsObject`/`JsArray` objects.
    - They can be recursively unwrapped with `Runtime.unwrap()`.
    - Methods that return a JavaScript value gain the keyword argument `unwrap`.

### Added
- `JsFunction` objects are now callable directly, without the need to use `Runtime.call()`.
    - They can be called as methods, by passing a keyword argument `this`.
- `Runtime.get(object, property, unwrap=False)`.

## [0.2.0] - 2024-02-02
### Fixed
- Create at most 1 `Runtime` per thread, to fix the segfault when too many `Runtime` objects are created on the stack.

## [0.1.0] - 2024-01-19
Initial release: module loading, code evaluation, type conversions, function calls.
